# TerraSurf-Mod
A Minecraft Forge mod that introduces a rideable, entity offering unique movement across various terrains. 
Become the Beast: Instead of just riding a mount, your player becomes the entity itself, offering a unique first-person experience.

Dynamic Movement: Surf across water, lava, and ice at high speeds. Run across land and even climb walls!

Enchantment Synergy: The experience changes based on enchantments applied to the TerraSurfer Helmet:

Riptide: Allows for full underwater travel, controlled by your camera. Riptide III grants a speed boost on the water's surface and constant energy regeneration while submerged.

Channeling: Grants night vision during the night and calls down lightning upon your foes during thunderstorms.

Flow: A treasure enchantment that boosts speed and energy efficiency.

Energy System: Your transformed state is powered by an energy bar, which depletes over time and must be managed.

How to Use
Craft the TerraSurfer Helmet:

The recipe requires Nautilus Shells, a Heart of the Sea, buckets of water and lava, and a Trident.

Equip the Helmet: Place the TerraSurfer Helmet in your head armor slot.

Transform: While on solid ground, press the 'V' key to transform into the TerraSurfer.

Dismount: Press the sneak key (left shift by default) to transform back. There is a 15-second cooldown before you can transform again.!
